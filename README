See https://blake2.net/ for information about BLAKE2

This is an implementation of BLAKE2 for PowerPC AltiVec.
It achieves 8.7 cycles/byte and hashes 120 MB/s on a puny 1.2 GHz PPC G4 7447A,
which is faster than sha1sum's SHA-1.

Of course I'll be happy if there are any ways to improve upon my altivec core.

BLAKE2s features implemented are: sequential, salted, keyed, arbitrary digest
size.


to build:

    make blake2s-altivec

run testsuite:

    ./blake2s-altivec

checksum:

    ./blake2s-altivec FILE
